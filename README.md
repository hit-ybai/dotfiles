## Tyler Dot Files

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.

### Installation

If you don't want to compile YouCompleteMe manually, you should uncomment the do block for line `Plug 'Valloric/YouCompleteMe' ", { 'do': './install.py --clang-completer' }` by simply removing the `"` mark.

```
git clone git://github.com/hit-ybai/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
rake install
vim +PlugInstall +qall
```

If you would like to use zsh and on-my-zsh, then you should run this:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
rake install
```
